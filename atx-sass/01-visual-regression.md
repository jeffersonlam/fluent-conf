## Notes
* Visual diff tool  
    * Shows visual diffs between two images
    * Wraith, Gemini, WebDriverCSS

Tests run off a yml file

* A: Very poorly. There are a lot of drawbacks to wraith; the good things are that it's super simple to set up.

#### Gemini
Tests also run off a yml file  

#### WebDriverCSS
