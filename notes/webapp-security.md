## Personal Notes
This talk was hard to follow. The material was presented in a very rigid way: topic, material, topic, material. There was no sense of humor or humanity anywhere, and there wasn't any passion or interest behind the subject matter. As a result, it was hard to follow, and I don't think the audience was very engaged. The content was there, and these are things to consider when building an app, but it wasn't presented in a digestible way.  
* Don't present like you're a robot.
* Try to put some humor into it
* Don't take yourself so seriously
* Talk as though you're talking to a friend
* Make your slides visually digestable at a glance. Remember the 5 second rule (if the slide's content isn't understood within about 5 seconds, you should change it)
