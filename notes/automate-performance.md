"How fast is your site?"  
*shrug*  
This is not an acceptable answer.  

Pull up your chrome dev tools and look at the resources waterfall. That's one way. But there's more.  

##### Grunt
* grunt-devperf
  Based on PhantomJS
* css-stats
* grunt-contrib-imagemin

##### More Tools
* [WebPageTest](http://www.webpagetest.org/)
Set up your own WebPageTest server.  
"They have set this up so that it's so stunningly easy." </sarcasm>
