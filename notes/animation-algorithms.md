## Notes
> "For the designers in the audience, this is definitely a talk for you."
Animation History: Old men at disney. The senior animators drew out the "key frames": the frames which were "key" to the animation. The junior animators filled in the betweens. This is where we get the term "key frames"
> "Animations are cognitive aids"
Affordance, percieved affordance & signifiers  
Humans are good at scanning text top-to-bottom, but we can miss a lot from scanning.  
Humans are really good at detecting motion in their peripheral vision.  

##### The basics of animation: interpolation

##### Example: Right/wrong buttons, with and without shake animation
Having a sort of playful element to your interface lets people trust it more, and makes people less frustrated.  
    The shake is definitely a cultural thing, but animations can add more meaning.

##### Context: Pull-refresh
    A great way for the user to not leave their context. (It can also become an addictive behavior, like a slot machine, what's next what's next)

##### How do you communicate animation ideas?

All of animation is just math. Using a tiny bit of JS, or CSS options, you can play around with animations.  

##### Easing
> "We hate linear animations. It looks super unnatural to us."  
> "Nothing in the universe is linear. We are subject to yaw, to force, to friction."  
* Ease-in
* Ease-out
    Kind of like someone walking into a room and slowing down to their seat.
    > "Ease-out: very comfortable for users to see. It's a natural scenario that happens to us pretty generally."

##### More easing
* Elasticity
    Be careful with this one: over-use could lease to cognitive overload. 
* Bounce
    Don't over-use.

> "We use style-guides for a lot of things. We can use an animation style guide around easing."

##### Animation software for designers
* Adobe Edge Animate
* Adobe After Effects
* Flinto
* Keynote
* Quartz
> "But translating this into HTML/CSS takes time."

##### JS Frameworks
* Framer.js
* Tween.js
* GSAP (Greensock)
* jQuery

##### CSS animation tools
* Animate.css
* CSSanimate.com
* SASS/LESS mixins

##### Performance

##### Go forth and animate!
Designers: jump into the browser. It's not that scary.
> "Having a toolset [designers and devs] can all share is really critical for us to..." 
    start collaborating better and innovating

## Action Items
* [ ] "Go forth and animate!"
* [ ] Think about animations when designing/developing
* [ ] Utilize JS/CSS animation frameworks
