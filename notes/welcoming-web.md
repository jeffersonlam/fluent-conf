Recruiters.  
"Seeking to hire "like-minded" people ends up being a euphamism for hiring like-skinned, like-gendered, and like-aged people."  
->Male, white or asian, milennial age.  
Sexism, ageism, and racism. "I don't want to be working on this. The -isms interfere with me being able to do my best work."  

"Many recruiters are looking for ninjas, rockstars, and cowboys."  

"In reality, we're all average. ... Like all of you, I'm average."  
"You're already skilled, so don't look for your clone. Look for someone different from you, who complements your skills."
