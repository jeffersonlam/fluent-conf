Recruiters.  
> "Seeking to hire "like-minded" people ends up being a euphamism for hiring like-skinned, like-gendered, and like-aged people."  
->Male, white or asian, milennial age.  
Sexism, ageism, and racism. "I don't want to be working on this. The -isms interfere with me being able to do my best work."  

> "Many recruiters are looking for ninjas, rockstars, and cowboys."  

> "In reality, we're all average. ... Like all of you, I'm average."  
> "You're already skilled, so don't look for your clone. Look for someone different from you, who complements your skills."  

Post your job postings on places more than hackernews and reddit. Those only reach a small, specific demographic.  
> 50% of women in STEM leave due to hostile work environments.

> "You have the power to fill those gaps. Someone helped you get to where you are, so give back."  
> "Be a super plumber. Fix those leaks."  
> "Privilege is when you think something is not a problem because it's not a problem to you personally." @davidgaider
> "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter." Martin Luther King
> A father and son are in a car that stalled on railroad tracks. An oncoming train... 'I cannot operate on this child, this is my son.'  

Rules
* Use the same language for everyone
* Use merit, not potential, as bench marks.
* Assume devs are AS skilled as you.
* Assume devs are correct.
* Listen. Do not interrupt.
*

Directives
* Give directives (instead of constructive criticism). Tell people what you want them to do.
* Incorporate improv principles. (Yes, and..., rather than no.).
* Onboard everyone
* Include everyone. (Don't make them always about drinking - not everyone drinks)
* Formalize processes. (The more processes are implemented, the more unconcious biases will be eliminated)

Teach others. Teaching benefits you just as much as it benefits others.
