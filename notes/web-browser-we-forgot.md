## Notes
Line-mode browser. We might call it a minimal-viable-product.  
It didn't support a ton of stuff that we use today, because it didn't exist back then.  
FluentConf website: takes a while to get to the content  
Github website: content available right away  
Stack Overflow website: content also available right away  
This browser serves as a great reminder that **progressive enhancement** is very important, for a backwards-compatible and future-friendly web.  
It also makes it easy to iterate on a minimum viable product
