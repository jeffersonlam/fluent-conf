> "Once you see programming languages through the filter of how you see human languages... "
> "JavaScript even has dialects. You might call them browsers."
> "Every time people tell you not to do something, it's because you can do it. They just don't like it."
> "Warning: JSLint will hurt your feelings."
> "When a word has this transition in meaning, people call it a skunked term. Because it has a bad smell."
> "I haven't slept for ten days, because that would be too long."
