#### 1. Ease of creating apps  
H1 2013: 0 Node apps. Apps looked very dated.  
H2 2013: 1 Node app. Had apps that looked very modern.  
Now: 67 Node apps. In just 18 months.  

#### 2. Velocity of pushing code
In 2011, even a simple content copy change could take 6 weeks to get live.  
In 2013, it took less than a minute for a copy change.  
Before, it took 2 months to change header/footer.  
Now, it takes 2 minutes.  
300 live code pushes in a few months.  

#### Experimentation mindset
The UI Layer is the Experimentation Layer.  
First PayPal app in Angular.js  
dustjs, angular, ember, react, react native, nodejs as apps, nodejs as services
