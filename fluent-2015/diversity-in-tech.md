## Notes
> "It wasn't long before I realized I was different, and my presence made other people curious or even uncomfortable."
Not just my appearance, but my name.  
> "I learned to make myself less different, just so I could make my life a little easier."
> "I was almost Olivia."
> "What I didn't realize at the time was that I was casually erasing my identity."

##### What does this have to do with Tech?
Moving to Toronto was finally a way for me to blend in.  
Until, I finished school and started working in tech.  

Assumption: "Tech is a meritocracy. It's a pipeline problem."  

##### What's in a name?
> "Why do some employees prefer to interview Matthew, but not Samir?"
    "English-speaking employers in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver were 35% more likely to interview an applicant with an English sounding name"

##### Why does John get the STEM job rather than Jennifer?
Study where they screened a resume with the name "Jennifer" or "John".  
Scientists perceived "Jennifer" as less compitent than "John".  

##### Toronto Census
It's not that people were mean to me, but there were more inappropriate jokes and behaviors.  
Found myself withdrawing to avoid what I knew would be uncomfortable situations.  

##### Code Switching
Subtly, or as a reflex, changing the way we express ourselves. Moving between different cultural and linguistic spaces and different parts of our own identities.

Decided I'm going to stop hiding myself.  
> Me and a friend: "You like Jay-Z!?" "Yeah."
    And I could see him trying to recategorize me.

"Diversity often defaults to women, and diversity often defaults to white women."

2014 Diversity Stats: 90% male, 10% female, all across the board in tech companies.  
2014 Ethnic diversity stats: 60 asian, 34 white...

##### The Model Minority Myth
> "Asians are hard-working, and smart, and good at math and science..."

##### Being a "real" programmer
You have to drink beer, play ping-pong...  
> "I can't see myself identifying with this culture"
> "This feeling of exclusion isn't just in ..."
> "I can only speak for myself and my experiences. There are a lot of other under-represented groups who would like their voices heard as well."

##### Culture & Education
> "Attracting new people to CS programs and coding bootcamps is one step, but reinforcing the existing culture in these educational environments may cause those new faces to leave before they even finish."
> "I make a conscious effort to not impose culture on my students."
> "My college students are more of a diverse bunch than in my workspace."

##### Culture & The Workplace
> "Hiring for cultural fit is important, but it doesn't mean hiring people just like me - people I would want to be *friends* with."

##### Why is diversity important?
> "Growing the talent pool will be difficult."
> "Happy employees."

##### What can we do?
> "It's difficult to confront or admit you may harbor feelings that go against your beliefs about equality, but identifying it is the first step to correcting it."
> "Be conscious of these biases. Sometimes, all you have to do is stop, listen, and pay attention."
> "The privilege of having privilege is to never have to think about it."

## Action Items
* [ ] Be conscious of these biases in diversity.
* [ ] Don't reinforce the existing tech culture.
