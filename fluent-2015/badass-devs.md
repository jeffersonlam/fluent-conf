If you ask 10k people what a dev needs to know, you'll get 10k answers.

"What do you need to know?" is the wrong question.
"How can you learn to build your skills quickly?"

Humans, unicorns, and humanoids.  
"You've been mistaken for a humanoid."  
Cognitive resources.  
2 vs 7  
Fruit or Cake?  
It's all one tank of resources. Willpower, memory... all one tank of resources, called cognitive resources.  
"Do you make people choose cake?"  
"Your open source documentation makes everyone choose cake."  
Death by a thousand **cognitive micro-leaks**.  
Expertise requires **cognitive resource management**.  

### How to get way better way faster
(from a cognitive resources perspective)

A Can't do  
B Can do with effort  
C Mastered

Pile up on B  
  Too many cognitive resources getting drained

Half-assed skills on C  
  Nobody wants to pull it back and refine it

It takes too long. This is a slow process

Fixing the pile-up on B  
  Solution: Keep things on A
  Split B into subskills, and take those subskills to C.

half-a-skill beats a half-assed-skill

Take a skill from can't do to mastered within:
max 3 sessions
max 45-90 minutes/session
If you can't do this, the thing is too big.

Practice does not make perfect. Practice makes permanent.

Think: What's on your C?

"We need to bypass B where we can."  
Speed up A and B. "Speed up A to B to C."  
Story about chick sexers (determing gender of chicks)  
  Pair beginners with experts.  
  Beginners got better without ever knowing how they got better.  
  Plane-spotting WW2  
    Same story  
  This is the thing about experts. "I just... know."  

Pilot story:  
They took non-pilots and paired them with pilots. After 3 hours...  
Non-pilots out-scored seasoned pilots (pilots with 1k-2k hours of flight time)  

Why is this not used?  
This is called **perceptual learning**.  

We need high-quality, high-quantity examples  
This is what we don't do. We just see 2 or 3 examples, like in a textbook or something.  

"Look at the people around you. They are not humanoids, or unicorns, they are... humans. And just visualize them bleeding out of cognitive resources."
